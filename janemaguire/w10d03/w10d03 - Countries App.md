# Countries App

## Introduction

Practising what we've done today your task it to make an app that lists all of the continents and their respective countries.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an app to store information about the countries 
- Each country needs: 
	- **`name`**
	- **`image`** of its flag (the image has to be displayed)
	- **`size`** (how many square miles of surface)
	- **`population`**
	- a first **`language`**
	- maybe more (_currency_, _GDP_, etc.)
	- Countries should belong to a continent

You app should have some styling before proceeding to the bonus sections, add a framework if you want to.

**Bonus:**
