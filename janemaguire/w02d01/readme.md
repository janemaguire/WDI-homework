You have the `sounds.zip` zip which contains all the wav files.

## Introduction

Your task is to make a Daft Punk soundboard using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the HTML5 audo tag.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create a grid using HTML and position it with CSS
- Every sound should be linked to a button, each button should create the correct sound

**Bonus:**

- Add some styling!

#### Starter code

You have been given a folder with all the sound files you will need to complete the exercise.

## Important Tip!

In order to play sound files from your machine, you will need to run the app as if it was on a live website. To do this, you can navigate to the folder that contains the index.html and then use the command:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Make sure you run this at the root of the app, where the `index.html` is found. Then navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/`.
